Full Stack Web Development

This is my Full Stack Web Development project named "We Donate". 

Front end -> HTML, CSS, JS, Bootstrap

Backend -> PHP

Database -> SQL

Responsive

Idea Behind "We Donate":

The site is made to act as an interface between donors who want to donate items and NGOs who want to accept those items to help the people who are in need. It helps the NGOs to reach the people who are actually interested in donating any of their valuable item which can benefit a person in need. It has simple and responsive interface for the user who wants to donate anything masks, books etc. to pass the information to the NGOs which would contact the user regarding further follow back and it would eliminate the chances of middleman taking the advantages of the cycle and benefitting himself. It would make donating much more easier and a high volume of donors will also be seen in a short period of time due to the fact that people in the world may have things to give away but what they lack is the time required to do so.
